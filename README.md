# whats-better-than-a-slider1
This is my part of my 2nd homework assignment from my Javascript Homework assignments.  I'm using Add Class/ remove class along with some CSS to make each picture come to life one at a time by adding a "current" class with some nice transition effects and then adding a "previous class" to remove the effect and then adding a "current" class to the next div and so on.
